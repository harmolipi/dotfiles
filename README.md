# Harmolipi's dotfiles

I recently started learning to use Neovim and gradually crafting my configuration, so I'm saving/publishing my settings here as I go. My settings are largely based on the setup of Takuya Matsuyama ([devaslife on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/devaslife)), who has inspired me to go down this wonderful rabbit hole.

This is very much a work in progress and I really don't know what I'm doing, so beware of copying my configuration! Better yet, [take a look at Takuya's](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public).

## Helpful notes
Just some things, mostly for myself, to remember:
- Directory structure info: `:h 'runtimepath'`
